# Feed Reader Testing

Project created as part of the Udacity Front-End Developer Nanodegree. A web-based application is given that reads RSS feeds and must pass the required tests. 
Jasmine was included so the application could be tested.

## Run the Application

1. Download/clone this repository. Open the file (`index.html`) in a browser and jasmine's tests are going to be displayed at the bottom of page. 
2. To start editing the test suites find the file (`jasmine/spec/feedreader.js`).
